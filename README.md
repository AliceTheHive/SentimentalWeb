# Sentimental Web
Sentimental is an ASP.net 5 web application which facilitates sentiment and key phrase analysis. It is based on the Azure Machine Learning Text Analysis service. 

The web application is pre-configured to be used with [ManifoldJS](http://manifoldjs.com/) via a [W3C Web App Manifest file](http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/manifest/). There is also some code that uses the [Windows Hosted Web App (Project Westminster)](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/07/06/project-westminster-in-a-nutshell/) capabilities. The website will also function as an [Office add-in](http://dev.office.com/getting-started/addins)

Sentimental is available as an Office add-in in the Office store. The project is an Office Task Pane add-in manifest and associated web application written in plain HTML and Javascript.
